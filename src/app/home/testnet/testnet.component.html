<ion-card-content>
  The testnet is an alternative Bitcoin block chain, to be used for testing.
  Testnet coins are separate and distinct from actual bitcoins, and are never
  supposed to have any value. This allows application developers or bitcoin
  testers to experiment, without having to use real bitcoins or worrying about
  breaking the main bitcoin chain.
